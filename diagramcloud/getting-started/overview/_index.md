## **Aspose.Diagram Cloud**
Aspose.Diagram is a REST API for working with the Microsoft Visio Object Model. Aspose.Diagram provides better performance and is easier to use to manipulate diagrams and convert files than Microsoft Office Automation.

Aspose.Diagram takes advantage of advanced functionalities provided by Microsoft Office Visio to manipulate Visio diagrams on a server. The Aspose.Diagram REST API is easy to use, compact and provides all the most common functionality so that developers can write less code. 
### **Rich Features**
**Create**:

- Create diagrams from scratch.

**Export**:

- Export diagrams (VSD, VSDX, VSS, VSSX, VTX, VDX, VDW, VST, VSTX and VSX) to popular image formats (BMP, JPEG, TIFF, EMF, SVG and PNG).
- Export diagrams (VSD, VSDX, VSS, VSSX, VTX, VDX, VDW, VST, VSTX and VSX) to PDF.
- Export diagrams (VSD, VSDX, VSS, VSSX, VTX, VDX, VDW, VST, VSTX and VSX) to HTML.
- Export diagrams (VSD, VSDX, VSS, VSSX, VTX, VDX, VDW, VST, VSTX and VSX) to XML Paper Specification (XPS).
- Export diagrams (VSD, VSDX, VSS, VSSX, VTX, VDX, VDW, VST, VSTX and VSX) to Macromedia Flash File Format (SWF).
- Export diagrams (VSD, VSDX, VSS, VSSX, VTX, VDX, VDW, VST, VSTX and VSX) to XAML.
### **SDKs**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-diagram-cloud) for a complete list of Aspose.Diagram SDKs along with working examples, to get you started in no time. Please check [Available SDKs](/available-sdks/) article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.
### **API Explorer**
[Aspose.Diagram Cloud API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/diagram/) is the easiest way to try out our APIs right away in your browser! It allows you to effortlessly interact and try out every single operation our APIs exposes.
### **Security and Authentication**
The Aspose.Diagram Cloud APIs are secured and requires authentication. There are two ways to authenticate Aspose REST APIs:

1. OAuth 2.0
1. URL Signing

Please check [Authenticating API Requests](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/storagecloud/Authenticating+API+Requests) article for more details.
